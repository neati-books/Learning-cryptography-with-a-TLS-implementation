		<p>
		Members can take part in AdNET by including banner image on their websites,
		or by making people access adnet with your ID(i.e. https://adnet.zeta2374.com/ID)
		via your contents like youtube videos.
		</p>
		<p>
		The more clicks your website induces, the more your own banners will be displayed.
		Webpage id hit will also count as one click.
		If your website made 10 people click banners, and other website made 5 people to click,
		your own banner will be displayed two times more than the banner of the other.
		view count of your own banner / induced click of other banner will be the index for 
		showing your banner.
		</p>
		<p>
		Your click induce can be sold to other members if you have much higher click induce than 
		your own banner show and you don't want to advertise your contents so much.
		But this only happens when AdNET houses non-free ads.
		You will earn points per sold clicks.
		When it amounts to certain point you will be paid with cryptocurrency.

		We will share those profits with members,
		<b title='This rate can change according to financial status of AdNET. 
If this happens we will notice you properly.
We try our best to share not just ads but also profit.'>50 : 50</b>.
	If there was non-free ad banner among those clicks your webpage made,
	you will get profit according to your contribution to all the clicks.
		</p>
		<p>
		All the banner display will be shared among the members.
		But, AdNET will use some portion of banner display, and charged ad will also consume 
		some display, the rest will be shared among members.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyone can advertise on AdNET at some cost per view.
		10 korean won per display as of now.
		There is no price per click, only price per display is offered.
		Your ad will be randomly distributed among member sites.
		Members can also buy additional display on adnet with the same cost as above.
		Therefore non-free commercial ads will be charged by cost per view.
		Whereas the profit will be distributed to members of AdNET according to cost per clicks.
		This policy will encourage the ads to be attractive and AdNET banner position 
		to be noticeable.
		</p>
		<p>
		A Member can include AdNET banner at any place with any size in your webpage.
		But please just mind that clicks will be counted, not the display.
		You can also add banners in multiple places.
		</p>
		<p>
		You should upload 3 types of your own banner.
		Your banner will be shown randomly on member websites.
		If you do not upload all 3 banners, you will get significant disadvantage in displaying your banner.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can only upload JPG files. File size must be less than 100k.
		Width-height ratio should be maintained.
		In example, for 300x250 size banner you can upload a 600x500 or 360x300 file.
		6 : 5 ratio must be maintained. 
		</p>

	Sample files.
	Default images will change to your own banner if it is uploaded.
